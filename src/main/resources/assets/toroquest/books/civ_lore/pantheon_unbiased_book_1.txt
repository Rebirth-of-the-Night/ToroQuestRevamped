A Pantheon Unbiased, Book I: Java, the God of Fate.

2 Even though faith differs greatly from civilization to civilazition, from village to village, even from house to house, Java is considered the most powerful god of all, by all.

3 For Java is the God of Fate, and fate itself, the force that gives every aspect of the world its meaning.

4 Java is what grounds the ground and airs the air and waters the waters.

5 Sun and Moon, the Fires Below, Life and Death, even the Endless Void are naught without them.

6 But there are very few people who actively worship java. How could they? Fate doesnÂ´t give a ****, as the Ancients said.

7 However, there are two groups of people with a known connection to Fate.

8 One are Blacksmiths, with their ability to decide the destiny of the metal they work on. Will it harm? Help? Both?

9 The other is the peculiar and elusive entity known as "The Unfateful Wanderer". See Book IX.
